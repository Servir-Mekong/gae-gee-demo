* Overview

This directory contains an incomplete Python website that is meant to
be run on Google App Engine and communicate with Google Earth Engine
and the Google Maps API.

* TODOs

- Install the Google App Engine Python SDK (is this the same as google-cloud-sdk?) and launch "dev_appserver.py ."
- Call localhost:8080/getmap to get eeMapId and eeToken (is this the right port?)
- In the Javascript console, run: showEEMap(eeMapId, eeToken) => "EE Map Type:" + eeMapType
- Uncomment // map.overlayMapTypes.push(eeMapType); in script.js
- Explore the cljs directory

* Certificate Error Note

Google apparently messed up the authentication certificates in (at
least) App Engine Python SDK versions 1.9.40 (where
urlfetch_cacerts.txt lacks any newer version of the cert) and 1.9.49
(where urlfetch_cacerts.txt contains the two expired versions and also
the current version).

According to a message thread at
https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=13477, the
fix is this:

#+begin_src sh
wget https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem -O /opt/google-cloud-sdk/platform/google_appengine/lib/cacerts/urlfetch_cacerts.txt
#+end_src

* Windows Library Note

OpenSSL and pyCrypto are not available by default on Windows 10. These
will need to be manually installed before launching dev_appserver.py.
